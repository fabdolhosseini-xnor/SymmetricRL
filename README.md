<h1 align="center">On Learning Symmetric Locomotion</h1>
This repo contains the code-base for the paper.

## Installation

There is no need for compilation. You can install all requirements using Pip, however, you might prefer to install some manully, including:
 - [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
 - [PyBullet](https://pybullet.org)


### Installation using Pip
```bash
# TODO: create and activate your virtual env of choice

# download the repo as well as the submodules (including )
git clone https://github.com/UBCMOCCA/SymmetricRL --recurse-submodules

cd SymmetricRL
pip install -r requirements  # you might prefer to install some packages (including PyTorch) yourself
```

There is also a helper script in `setup/setup_cc.sh` that can be used to install the requirements on [Compute Canada](http://computecanada.ca).


## Running Locally

To run an experiment named `test_experiment` with the PyBullet humanoid environment you can run:

```bash
./scripts/local_run_playground_train.sh  w2_test_experiment  env_name='pybullet_envs:Walker2DBulletEnv-v0'

# run the same experiment with the NET architecture symmetry method (other options include "traj, loss, phase, net2")
./scripts/local_run_playground_train.sh  w2_net_experiment  env_name='pybullet_envs:Walker2DBulletEnv-v0' mirror_method='net'
```

The `w2_net_experiment` is the name of the experiment. This command will create a new experiment directory inside the `runs` directory that contains the following files:

- `pid`: the process ID of the task running the training algorithm
- `progress.csv`: a CSV file containing the data about the the training progress
- `slurm.out`: the output of the process. You can use `tail -f` to view the contents
- `configs.json`: a JSON file containing all the hyper-parameter values used in this run
- `run.json`: extra useful stuff about the run including the host information and the git commit ID (only works if GitPython is installed)
- `models`: a directory containing the saved models

In case you use [Compute Canada](http://computecanada.ca) you also use the other scripts like `cedar_run_playground_train.sh` to create a batch job. These scripts use the same argument sctructure but also allow you to run the same task with multiple replicates using the `num_replicates` variable.

## Plotting Results

The `plot_from_csv.py` script can be helpful for plotting the learning curves:

```bash
python -m playground.plot_from_csv --load_paths runs/*/*/  --columns mean_rew max_rew  --smooth 2

# to group the results based on the name
python -m playground.plot_from_csv --load_paths runs/*/*/  --columns mean_rew max_rew  --name_regex ".*__([^_\/])*" --group 1
```

- The `load_paths` argument specifies which directories the script should look into
- It opens the `progress.csv` file and plots the `columns` as the y-axis and uses the `row` for the x-axis (defaults to `total_num_steps`)
- You can also provide a `name_regex` to make the figure legends simpler and more readable, e.g. `--name_regex 'walker-(.*)mirror\/'` would turn `runs/2019_07_08__23_53_20__walker-lossmirror/1` to simply `loss`.
- `group` can be used to aggregate the results of multiple runs of the same experiment into one. `name_regex` is used to specify the groups.


## Running Learned Policy

The `enjoy.py` script can be used to run a learned policy and render the results:

```bash
python -m playground.enjoy with experiment_dir=runs/<EXPERIMENT_DIRECTORY>

# plot the joint positions over time
python -m playground.evaluate with experiment_dir=runs/<EXPERIMENT_DIRECTORY> plot=True
```

## Evaluating Results

The `evaluate.py` script is used for evaluating learned policies. The results will be saved to a new file called `evaluate.json` inside the `experiment_dir` where the policy was loaded from.

```bash
# evaluate with 10000 steps
python -m playground.evaluate with experiment_dir=runs/<EXPERIMENT_DIRECTORY> max_steps=10000
# with rendering
python -m playground.evaluate with experiment_dir=runs/<EXPERIMENT_DIRECTORY> render=True

# evaluate all experiments
for d in runs/*/*/; do python -m playground.evaluate with experiment_dir=$d; done
```

Metrics (will be expanded):
 - Symmetric Index (joint angle and torque)
   * Uses the `MetricsEnv` environment wrapper from `symmetric/metric_utils.py`

**NOTE:** the current script assumes that the environment has a similar interface to PyBullet locomotion environments. It assumes the following parameters are present in the unwrapped environment:
  - `robot.feet_contact`
  - `robot.ordered_joints`
    - The joint names that have the word `left` in them are assumed to be on the left side. Any other joint that does not contain the word `abdomen` is assumed to be on the right side.

The environments that are currently tested and supported:
 - `Walker2DBulletEnv`
 - `HumanoidBulletEnv`
 - `Walker3DCustomEnv`
 - `Walker3DStepperEnv`
